// Initialize a variable max to store the maximum value and set it to negative infinity.
// Iterate through each element of the array.
// Compare each element with the current maximum (max).
// If the current element is greater than max, update max with the value of the current element.
// After iterating through the entire array, max will hold the maximum value.
// Return max.
