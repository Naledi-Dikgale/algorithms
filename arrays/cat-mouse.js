// You have a grid representing a room where a cat and a mouse are located.
// The cat is at position [x1, y1] and the mouse is at position [x2, y2].
// The goal is to determine if the cat can catch the mouse.
// The cat can move up, down, left, or right one cell at a time, but
// cannot pass through walls or obstacles.
// If the cat can reach the mouse, return true; otherwise, return false.
